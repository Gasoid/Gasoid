### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My main projects:
#### ðŸ¤– merge-bot
repo: https://github.com/Gasoid/merge-bot

The bot helps to manage Merge requests on Gitlab.


#### ðŸ“· photoDumper
repo: https://github.com/Gasoid/photoDumper

The tool downloads personal photos of VK albums. You can add your own source photos, you have to implement interfaces: check file sources/sources.go

#### ðŸ¤– regular-go-bot
repo: https://github.com/Gasoid/regular-go-bot

The telegram bot is for fun. You can easy add your own commands: just write a function as handler: check file commands.go
